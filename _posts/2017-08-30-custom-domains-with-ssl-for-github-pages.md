In a [previous post]({% post_url 2017-08-29-how-to-set-up-a-jekyll-blog %}), we discussed how to set up a Jekyll-based blog to be hosted using Github Pages. The process is straight-forward, and also free! So, if you've ever had a desire to start blogging, have a look at the previous post, and join us back here once you've set up your blog!

Now you have a blog, and the world is loving your content. But you're tired of handing out your nerdy `github.io` url (which I think is actually kind of cool). You want to solidify your blog on the internet. What steps should you take next? Absolutely, your next step is to create a custom domain from which people can securely access and share your content. We'll show you exactly how to do this using domains purchased through the [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/) service.

## Configuring Github

The first thing you'll need to do is tell Github that you plan on serving your site from your newly purchased domain name. To do that, visit your repository (created in the [previous post]({% post_url 2017-08-29-how-to-set-up-a-jekyll-blog %})), and click on the Settings icon. Then scroll down until you get to the Github Pages section, set the Custom Domain field to your new domain name, and hit save.

Now it's time to configure our name servers to point to Github.

## Configuring DNS

When you registered your domain through Google, it automatically set up it's own name servers to handle the requests for your domain. However, since Github Pages does not allow SSL for custom domains, we are going to take advantage of [Cloud Flare's Universal SSL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/). This will allow users to connect to our site securely, using HTTPS.

Head on over to [Cloud Flare](https://cloudflare.com/) and sign up for an account. After doing so, just follow the steps below to set up DNS records for your new domain.

### Add a Website

Fill in your domain name and click Begin Scan.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2017-08-30-custom-domains-with-ssl-for-github-pages/cloudflare-add-site.png" %}

This will request all of the available records for your current domain. The results should be empty if you have recently created your domain. You can verify any records found in the next step. Watch the video while waiting, it's pretty good I guess :)

### Verify/Configure DNS Records

#### A Records

An A record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. We will need to create an A record for your domain that points to Github's servers, `192.30.252.153`, and `192.30.252.154`. These addresses were obtained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider).

#### CNAME Records

A Canonical Name or CNAME record is a type of DNS record that maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name. CNAME records are typically used to map a subdomain such as www or mail to the domain hosting that subdomainâ€™s content. We will use it for mapping `www` to our origin, or root name, `@`. Upon hitting save, the `@` will be translated into your root domain name automatically. In the end, your DNS records should look similar to the ones above.

### Select a Cloudflare Plan

### Set New Nameservers

Cloudflare will now ask you to change your domain's name servers over from Google to Cloudflare.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2017-08-30-custom-domains-with-ssl-for-github-pages/cloudflare-name-servers.png" %}

#### Changing Your Nameservers

The changes can be made by clicking on the `Configure DNS` button in your [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar#chp=t) account. Under the _Name servers_ section, you should select _Use custom name servers_ and fill in the name servers provided to you by Cloudflare. In my case, the result looked like this.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2017-08-30-custom-domains-with-ssl-for-github-pages/domain-configure-dns.jpg" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2017-08-30-custom-domains-with-ssl-for-github-pages/cloudflare-registrar-edit.png" %}

Note that the above changes could take up to 24 hours to take effect, but they usually happen within minutes.

## Final Cloudflare Settings

There are a few Cloudflare settings you'll want to set to ensure that users connections will always use HTTPS. These settings can all be found on the _Crypto_ tab of your Cloudflare site page.

* **SSL** - _Full_

* **Always Use HTTPS** - _On_

* **Enable HSTS** - _On (Read the warning carefully)_

* **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** - _On (Strongly encouraged)_

## That's a Wrap!

You can now visit your site using any normal means, and you should end up seeing a secured session signed by a trusted certificate to your custom domain name! Now go share your ideas with the world. Happy Hacking!
