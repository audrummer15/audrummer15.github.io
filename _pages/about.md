My name is Adam Brown, and I've been hacking away at my varied interests since 1990.
I'm a follower of Jesus, a Master of Software Engineering, an Offensive Security
Certified Professional, and a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur. I love to
help people, so feel free to reach out to me, and thanks for reading! Happy Hacking!
